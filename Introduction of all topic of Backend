Node Js Basics.......
-> It is a JavaScript run time environment.

   Story-- js se backend nahi ban sakta kyoki js ke pass wo functionalities nahi hai jinse backend banta hai.
           ryan dhal isne socha js se backend bannana chahiye.
           google chrome ka V8 engine ka code open source hai and yeh us code mein chhedkahani kar raha hai
           fir usne socha ki humme toh js mai code karna hai kyoki v8Engine bana hai c++ mai.
           he wrap the v8 engine code with js code so when we give js code then it handle by this wrapper then 
           this wrapper convert this code into c++ code  and give to v8 Engine and Thus,develope a server.
           The combination of whole of this is caleed as Node js.
           so,when the node js run then he create the server buit after closing it the server also off.
           it just like a generator.That's why node js called as Js run time environment.
